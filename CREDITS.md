This repository is adapted from the Kyle Huston, who did an initial
implementation of DRAM in his own [fork of PyMC](https://github.com/khuston/pymc).
I was originally working on my own implementation when I found his code,
which was much more complete. I scrapped my prototype and decided to
tidy up his code, which is what you see here.
